# Music advisor
Music advisor is an application based on Spotify API. Using this application you can get lists of featured music, new releases, 
etc. via Spotify API.<br/>
This application utilizes OAuth for getting access from Spotify API access server. 
The main entity of OAuth is the token, the secret code that should be sent with an HTTP request to API, 
so that the service is sure that you have enough rights to get information from API. <br/>
Before starting the application you should go to the https://developer.spotify.com and create your application.
To create an application:
1. you should select Dashboard tab on the site, log into Spotify, and click the button Create an App.
Specify redirect_uri as http://localhost:8080<br/>
When application is created you get client_id and client_secret.<br/>
2. Hardcode client_id and client_secret to CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET fields respectively in task/src/data package/SpotifyData.class.<br/>
